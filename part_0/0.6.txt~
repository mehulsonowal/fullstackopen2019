the window.onload defines an event handler for submit on a form

callback function is called when form is submitted; new note
is created and pushed onto the array of current notes;
the form is cleared; the page is rerendered with the redrawNotes()
function; finally a post request is made to update the json data

browser->server: HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa
